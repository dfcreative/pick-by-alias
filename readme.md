# pick-by-alias [![unstable](https://img.shields.io/badge/stability-unstable-green.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges)

Pick object properties by a list of aliases. May not sound as a great idea for API design, but that is really useful to avoid remembering exact option names from user point.

[![npm install pick-by-alias](https://nodei.co/npm/pick-by-alias.png?mini=true)](https://npmjs.org/package/pick-by-alias/)

```js
let pick = require('pick-by-alias')

let options = pick({
  positions: [...],
  color: 'rgba(0, 100, 200, .75)',
  viewBox: null,
  extra: 123
}, {
	positions: ['positions', 'points', 'data', 'coordinates'],
	color: ['colors', 'color', 'stroke'],
	viewport: ['viewport', 'viewBox']
})

// options === {positions, color, viewport}
```

### `result = pick(source, aliases)`

Return an object with properties picked by the list or dict of `aliases`. The `aliases` are matched in priority order, ie. the names going first are picked. Each alias can be an array or a comma/space-separated string.

```js
// pick by dict
let {a, b} = pick(src, {a: ['a', 'b', 'c'], b: 'd e f'})

// just pick props
let {c, d, e} = pick(src, ['c', 'd', 'e'])

// pick by string
let {f, g} = pick(src, 'f g')
```
